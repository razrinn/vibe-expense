[2025-05-26 22:57:27] - Decision: Implement manual cookie handling for session management. Rationale: User denied installation of `js-cookie` library. Implications: Custom cookie functions were added to `AuthContext.tsx`.

[2025-05-27 12:13:07] - Implemented dynamic imports for page components in src/App.tsx using React.lazy and React.Suspense to improve initial load performance.

[2025-05-27 12:39:30] - Centralized data clearing logic for expenses.
Rationale: Initially, `db.expenses.clear()` was called directly in `SettingsPage.tsx`, followed by a `refreshExpenses()` call from `ExpenseContext`. This led to a less cohesive design. By moving the `db.expenses.clear()` and `setExpenses([])` into a new `clearAllExpenses` function within `ExpenseContext`, the responsibility for managing expense data state and persistence is fully encapsulated within the context. This improves maintainability, reduces potential for inconsistencies, and provides a cleaner API for components.
Implications: Components needing to clear all expense data now only need to call `clearAllExpenses()` from `useExpenses`, simplifying their logic.
