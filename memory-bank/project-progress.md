# Project Progress & Status

## 1. Current Overall Status

Initial setup complete, UI components scaffolded, data persistence issue addressed, and analytics page updated to show category names. Bug fix for undefined categories applied. Refactored KeyMetrics to use useExpenses hook directly. Form input components have been refactored and applied throughout the application. The issue with ExpenseForm.tsx where the 'amount' field submitted as 0 and premature validation was occurring has been addressed. Month separation dividers have been added to the expense list.

## 3. What's Left to Build

- [ ] Expense CRUD functionality (Priority: High)
- [ ] Authentication system (Priority: High)
- [ ] Analytics dashboard (Priority: Medium)
- [ ] Data persistence (Priority: Medium) - _Addressed accidental clearing, but core persistence is via localStorage as per design._
- [ ] Responsive design (Priority: Low)

## 4. Known Issues & Bugs

- No critical issues identified.

## 5. Key Decisions & Changes Log

- (2025-05-25): Decision: Use React Context for state management - Rationale: Simple state needs, no need for Redux
- (25-05-2025): Decision: Local storage for data persistence - Rationale: Single-user app doesn't need backend
- (2025-05-25): Change: Added explicit confirmation for "Clear All Data" button in SettingsPage to prevent accidental data loss. Rationale: User reported data loss on re-login, found to be caused by accidental activation of clear data function.
- (2025-05-25): Change: Modified `KeyMetrics.tsx` to display category names instead of UUIDs for highest and lowest categories on the Analytics page. Rationale: Improved user experience and readability of analytics data.
- (2025-05-25): Bug Fix: Added a check for `categories` being defined and not empty in `getCategoryName` within `KeyMetrics.tsx` to prevent `TypeError`. Rationale: Resolved runtime error when `categories` might be undefined or empty during initial render.
- (2025-05-25): Refactor: Modified `KeyMetrics.tsx` to directly use `useExpenses` hook for `categories` instead of receiving it as a prop. Rationale: Simplifies prop drilling and makes the component more self-contained.
- (2025-05-25): Feature: Implemented user-selectable currency setting in `SettingsPage.tsx` with persistence via `localStorage`. Rationale: Provides user customization and flexibility for currency display.
- (2025-05-25): Refactor: Modified `formatCurrency` in `src/utils/formatters.ts` to accept currency code and locale as arguments, and updated all consuming components (`ExpensesPage.tsx`, `ExpenseList.tsx`, `KeyMetrics.tsx`, `CategoryChart.tsx`) to use the currency from `SettingsContext`. Rationale: Enables dynamic currency display based on user settings.
- (2025-05-25): Feature: Created `DailyGroupedExpenseList.tsx` and integrated it into `ExpensesPage.tsx` to display expenses grouped by day in a compact format. Rationale: Provides a different, more organized view of expenses on the main expenses page.
- (2025-05-25): Refactor: Created reusable `Input`, `Select`, and `Textarea` components in `src/components/ui/forms` and applied them to `ExpenseForm.tsx` for consistent styling and improved maintainability. Rationale: Addresses the user's request for nicely styled form inputs and improves code reusability.
- (2025-05-25): Refactor: Extended the application of `Input`, `Select`, and `Textarea` components to all relevant files (`CategoryManager.tsx`, `PinLogin.tsx`, `PinSetup.tsx`, `SettingsPage.tsx`, `ExpenseFilters.tsx`) for consistent UI and improved maintainability. Rationale: User requested to apply the new components throughout the application.
- (2025-05-25): Refinement: Separated PIN reset functionality into a new `resetPinAndLogout` function in `AuthContext.tsx`. The `logout` function no longer clears the PIN. Rationale: Ensures that a normal logout does not reset the user's PIN, while a dedicated PIN reset action correctly clears the PIN and prompts for setup.
- (2025-05-25): Diagnostic: Temporarily removed `required` validation from the 'description' field in `ExpenseForm.tsx` to diagnose premature validation error. Rationale: To determine if the "description is required" message is due to validation firing too early or a deeper rendering issue.
- (2025-05-25): Fix: Re-added `required` validation to 'description' field in `ExpenseForm.tsx`. Rationale: Restored intended validation after diagnostic step.
- (2025-05-25): Fix: Re-added `required` and `min` validation to 'amount' field in `ExpenseForm.tsx`. Rationale: Restored intended validation.
- (2025-05-25): Fix: `Input.tsx` now correctly uses `React.forwardRef` to allow `react-hook-form` to register inputs. Rationale: This was the root cause of the 'amount' field submitting as 0 and other potential input issues.
- (2025-05-25): Clean-up: Removed diagnostic `console.log` from `onFormSubmit` in `ExpenseForm.tsx`.
- (2025-05-25): Feature: Added month separation dividers to `DailyGroupedExpenseList.tsx`. Rationale: Improves readability and organization of the expense list by visually separating expenses by month.
- [x] Added daily total expense to `DailyGroupedExpenseList.tsx` (2025-05-25)

## 6. Next Steps

- User to verify that the Expense Form now functions correctly: no premature validation errors, and amount field correctly captures user input.
- Implement basic expense CRUD operations
- Set up authentication flow
- Create analytics dashboard components
