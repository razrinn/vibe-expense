## 4. Known Issues & Bugs

- No critical issues identified yet

## 5. Key Decisions & Changes Log

- (2025-05-25): Decision: Use React Context for state management - Rationale: Simple state needs, no need for Redux
- (25-05-2025): Decision: Local storage for data persistence - Rationale: Single-user app doesn't need backend
- (2025-05-25): Change: Added explicit confirmation for "Clear All Data" button in SettingsPage to prevent accidental data loss. Rationale: User reported data loss on re-login, found to be caused by accidental activation of clear data function.
- (2025-05-25): Change: Modified `KeyMetrics.tsx` to display category names instead of UUIDs for highest and lowest categories on the Analytics page. Rationale: Improved user experience and readability of analytics data.
- (2025-05-25): Bug Fix: Added a check for `categories` being defined and not empty in `getCategoryName` within `KeyMetrics.tsx` to prevent `TypeError`. Rationale: Resolved runtime error when `categories` might be undefined or empty during initial render.
- (2025-05-25): Refactor: Modified `KeyMetrics.tsx` to directly use `useExpenses` hook for `categories` instead of receiving it as a prop. Rationale: Simplifies prop drilling and makes the component more self-contained.
- (2025-05-25): Change: Optimized currency formatting to IDR in `src/utils/formatters.ts`. Rationale: Aligns with the project's regional context and provides more accurate currency representation.
- (2025-05-25): Feature: Implemented user-selectable currency setting in `SettingsPage.tsx` with persistence via `localStorage`. Rationale: Provides user customization and flexibility for currency display.
- (2025-05-25): Refactor: Modified `formatCurrency` in `src/utils/formatters.ts` to accept currency code and locale as arguments, and updated all consuming components (`ExpensesPage.tsx`, `ExpenseList.tsx`, `KeyMetrics.tsx`, `CategoryChart.tsx`) to use the currency from `SettingsContext`. Rationale: Enables dynamic currency display based on user settings.
- (2025-05-25): Feature: Created `DailyGroupedExpenseList.tsx` and integrated it into `ExpensesPage.tsx` to display expenses grouped by day in a compact format. Rationale: Provides a different, more organized view of expenses on the main expenses page.
- (2025-05-25): Refactor: Created reusable `Input`, `Select`, and `Textarea` components in `src/components/ui/forms` and applied them to `ExpenseForm.tsx` for consistent styling and improved maintainability. Rationale: Addresses the user's request for nicely styled form inputs and improves code reusability.
- (2025-05-25): Refactor: Extended the application of `Input`, `Select`, and `Textarea` components to all relevant files (`CategoryManager.tsx`, `PinLogin.tsx`, `PinSetup.tsx`, `SettingsPage.tsx`, `ExpenseFilters.tsx`) for consistent UI and improved maintainability. Rationale: User requested to apply the new components throughout the application.
- (2025-05-25): Refinement: Separated PIN reset functionality into a new `resetPinAndLogout` function in `AuthContext.tsx`. The `logout` function no longer clears the PIN. Rationale: Ensures that a normal logout does not reset the user's PIN, while a dedicated PIN reset action correctly clears the PIN and prompts for setup.

## 6. Next Steps

- Implement basic expense CRUD operations
- Set up authentication flow
- Create analytics dashboard components
