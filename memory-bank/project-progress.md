- [ ] Responsive design (Priority: Low)

## 4. Known Issues & Bugs

- No critical issues identified yet

## 5. Key Decisions & Changes Log

- (2025-05-25): Decision: Use React Context for state management - Rationale: Simple state needs, no need for Redux
- (2025-05-25): Decision: Local storage for data persistence - Rationale: Single-user app doesn't need backend
- (2025-05-25): Change: Added explicit confirmation for "Clear All Data" button in SettingsPage to prevent accidental data loss. Rationale: User reported data loss on re-login, found to be caused by accidental activation of clear data function.

## 6. Next Steps

- Implement basic expense CRUD operations
- Set up authentication flow
- Create analytics dashboard components
